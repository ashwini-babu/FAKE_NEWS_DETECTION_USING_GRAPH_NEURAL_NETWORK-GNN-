# FAKE_NEWS_DETECTION_USING_GRAPH_NEURAL_NETWORK-GNN-
Fake news - information content that is false, misleading or whose source cannot be verified for intentionally damage reputations, deceive, or to gain attention.
In today’s world, it is normal to receive news from online sources like social media. News is often subjective to readers and real news may be twisted in transmission.
Factors that contribute to the spread of false news are :
                   Low cost and low-budget online news sources 
                   simple accessibility via social platforms.
Graph Neural Networks are a form of deep learning approach that conducts prediction on graph-described data.
Graph Neural Networks are able to learn complex structural pattern to produce useful representation for fraud detection tasks like financial frauds, fake accounts and spam detection.
 
 OBJECTIVE:
 To develop Graph Neural Network for performing fake news detection and to get a better accuracy than the existing models.
We conduct extensive experiments on datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network(using Graph Attention Network) for detecting fake news.
To use news propagation graph along with text embeddings and perform graph classification. 
To improve the quality of prediction based on retweeting pattern and the preference of each node.
